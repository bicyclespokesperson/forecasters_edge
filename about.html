    <h1>Forecaster's Edge</h1><br>
    This site displays nearby disc golf courses and sorts them by the best weather conditions. Useful for deciding 
    on a course to play later in the day.
    <p>
    <h3>Location Input</h3>
    Enter either a ZIP Code (example: 12345) or a latitude, longitude coordinate pair (example: 12.345, -123.456).
    <br>
    <h3>Weather Score</h3>
    The weather score goes from 1 to 10, with 1 representing terrible weather 
    and 10 representing perfect weather. It roughly corresponds to the inverse 
    of the chance of precipitation; e.g. a course with a 70% chance of rain 
    will have a score of 3. The score is lowered if courses are too windy, 
    too hot, or too cold. 
    <br>
    <h3>Courses</h3>
    This site includes courses located in the USA that have at least 18 holes.
    <br>
    <h3>Timezones</h3>
    The time selected is assumed to be in the course's local timezone. This means
    the weather scores shown in the table aren't guaranteed to be at the same time 
    if the table includes courses in multiple timezones.
